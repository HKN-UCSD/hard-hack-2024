        H.A.R.D. Hack is a hardware hackathon that HKN holds annually in
        collaboration with IEEE and Triton Neurotech. We provide the materials
        and the tools needed to make a hardware hack. Come out and build
        something cool! Anyone can attend, regardless of skill level, major, or
        university. Group up into teams of 4 and compete with your fellow
        engineering students overnight. Food will be provided!
        <br />
        <br />
        Top builds that align with the project theme will earn a prize! In
        previous years, winning teams have won speakers, mice, and other fun
        tech.
