    “SOFTWARE COMES FROM HEAVEN WHEN YOU HAVE GOOD HARDWARE” - KEN OLSEN
  </p>

  <p class="basic-paragraph">
    Gordon Moore made an insightful observation that defined the trajectory of modern digital transformation. Decades
    over, drastic growth in computer chips’ performances paved the way for the rapid development of life-changing
    technologies, including wireless communications, autonomous driving, and artificial intelligence. However, as the
    software industry continues to boom, many students interested in hardware felt overshadowed in most hackathons.
  </p>

  <p class="basic-paragraph">
    At H.A.R.D. Hack, we aim to provide our participants with a wide variety of advanced hardware components and
    high-quality community support, so that our next generation of engineers will better master system integration
    skills.
    Students from multidisciplinary backgrounds collaborate to develop projects by integrating hardware and software to
    address real-life issues. Our projects in the past include TrashBot that collects recycled bottles autonomously and
    EasyCare that assigns tasks based on the patient’s brain waves.
